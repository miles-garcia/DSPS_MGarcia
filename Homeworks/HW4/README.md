# **Homework 4**

## Contributions
I worked with Sarah, Masooma, Tali, Zach, and Paula on the first question (Dark Matter). Zach and Tali were a bit ahead on the final printing function, so they helped a bit more with that part. Everyone else was working at roughly the same time on things, so we bounced ideas off of each other and compared results.
I worked separately on the second part (MCMC) and worked a bit with Masooma checking our results of the histograms.

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
The Dark Matter part was again about manipulating data and gettning information out of the data to compare to some known quantity (in this case, the 1/sqrt(R) dependence of the velocity that comes from Newton's laws). 
The MCMC part was about building a simple MCMC sampling algorithm.

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
I spent a while processing the MCMC algorithm, even though it was ultimately pretty straightforward, I had to make sure I understood the difference between the sampling function vs. the proposal function, and just generally understanding WHY it would produce a result that reflected the sample PDF when plotting the samples

### Easiest part of the HW?
Didn't have much trouble with the data manipulation for the Dark Matter part.

### One new thing I learned?
I think between this HW and class, I'm getting a much better feel for what MCMC is doing, so I think that was a useful exercise.
