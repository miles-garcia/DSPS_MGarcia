# **Homework 7**

## Contributions
I mainly worked alone on this assignment, but I discussed a few things with Masooma and Sarah. 

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
Visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional data using projections and clustering. 

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Probably just understanding how to use the different clustering functions and making sure they were working properly, but once I did the first couple ones, subsequent ones became easier. Another tricky thing was actually analyzing the results of the clustering and projections-- what can we actually say when we see one? What do the clusters tell us?

### Easiest part of the HW?
Whitening the data and manipulating the results of the projections/clustering to plot it.

### One new thing I learned?
I think an interesting thing I learned is that even if you can cluster the data, that's really only half (or less?) of the battle. How to interpret the clusters is more meaningful and more challenging. It's easy when the clusters are nice and you have clear groups, but with like 75 dimensions and no seemingly obvious reason for the clusters I got a lot of the time, getting meaning from the cluster results and 2-D projections was tough.
