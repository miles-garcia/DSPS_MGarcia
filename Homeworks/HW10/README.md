# **Homework 10**

## Contributions
I worked with Masooma, Sarah, and Tali on different parts of the assignment. 

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
This homework went through the construction of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve a complicated PDE, and also how to maximize the accuracy of the PINN by modifying hyperparameters such as the learning rate and number of epochs the NN trains for.

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Getting the loss function and gradient functions to work in the code for the PINN. It was hard for me to fully understand what the purpose of the gradient function was (like, what the inputs/outputs were even supposed to be) so that took a while to understand. 

### Easiest part of the HW?
Once again I think building the NNs was simple, and the adjustments we made (changing activation fcns, learning rate, loss, #epochs) all made sense as to why we might want to change those (even if I wasn't directly responsible for coding some of that)

### One new thing I learned?
I think I learned a lot about how important the loss function can be to your specific task-- it was very cool to see how adding the PDE to the PINN loss really allowed the NN to "solve" the PDE. 


(By the way, I am using the 72 hr extension on this assignment)
