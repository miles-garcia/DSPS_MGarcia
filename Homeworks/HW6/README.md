# **Homework 6**

## Contributions
I worked at separate times with Shar, Masooma, Sarah, Zach, and Tali on separate portions of the assignment. Shar helped me with adding different Kernels; Zach helped me with comparing optimization methods. Everyone else helped with comparing code and fixing issues as well as understanding what we were supposed to do and how things were supposed to work.

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
Using Gaussian Processes to fit data and interpolate between datapoints, as well as extrapolate the data to predict future points.

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Learning how to use the george package, and what it was actually doing, as well as getting the optimizations to work (because of issues with george, mainly the positive-definite kernel stuff, I think)

### Easiest part of the HW?
Working with the data to get for example x-axes that were in the same format (I ended up going for days since 1950). This took a bit of work, transforming the given data to datetimes, taking differences, etc., but it made sense to me in the end.

### One new thing I learned?
A lot about Gaussian Process implementation, plus a bit of how they actually work.
