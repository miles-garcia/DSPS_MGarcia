# **Homework 1**

## Contributions
I worked with Sarah and Masooma for most of this assignment. For the first question, writing code and cross-checking was split equally among group members. For the second question, I took charge of the method for generating the distributions, while the other group members cross checked our results and generated the plots. All group members were responsible for general feedback and ensuring that outputs included all necessary aspects. I worked alone on the combined histogram and gaussian fits.

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
This homework engaged in the understanding of different distributions, how to interpret them, and also the application of the Central Limit Theorem and law of large numbers. This generally goes back to the discussion of statistics in class, as we specifically talked about the Law of Large Numbers and CLT, as well as the general overview of distributions, their moments, and what they represent in a physical sense.

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Probably fitting the data, but mainly because I wanted to try writing the minimization function myself before switching to just using curvefit from scipy. 

### Easiest part of the HW?
I think generating the plots once we had the distributions was something I was very comfortable with.

### One new thing I learned?
In terms of the data fitting, the difference you can get from fitting the edge of the bins vs. the center of the bins (and how to get the center of the bins quickly).
