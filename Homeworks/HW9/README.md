# **Homework 9**

## Contributions
Masooma helped me with the last part of this assignment (the ROC curve) but other than that I was working alone.

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
Using Tree methods to perform regression and classification tasks on a dataset, as well as evaluating the performance of the tree models and optimizing the models.

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Probably getting the loss functions as this took a bit of extra work to calculate. 

### Easiest part of the HW?
Running the Tree Models was very simple and intuitive, especially when looking at the documentation.

### One new thing I learned?
How to make and evaluate tree models, I had never done something with them before so it was interesting to see how simple it was to implement and modify to optimize!
