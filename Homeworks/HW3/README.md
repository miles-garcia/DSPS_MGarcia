# **Homework 3**

## Contributions
I worked at separate times with Sarah, Masooma, Shar, Paula, and Zach on separate portions of the assignment. I was mainly responsible for the things I wrote down (as were the people I worked with for their individual work); we mainly just compared code and results to help look for issues if something wasn't working. 

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
This homework was mostly about reading in and manipulating large datasets for a particular purpose/goal, and then applying a statistical test (the KS test) to that data and interpreting the results in the p value framework, and comparing those results to others' results using the same/similar data (ie., Corral 2018)

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Probably doing the data manipulation to get the data gaps normalized and ready for the KS test was difficult, because the pseudocode given to us was useful, but I think it was poorly explained in the actual paper itself, which meant it was really hard to understand how to combine what the pseudocode with the actual paper's information (to ultimately compare with the paper's graphs and tables), so I spent a lot of time closely reading the paper and comparing their methods with what the psuedocode was telling me to do.

### Easiest part of the HW?
Reading in the data and working with the dataframes was something I was familiar with. Sometimes things didn't work exactly, and it took a minute to figure out what was wrong, but I never felt like I didn't know how to solve those issues, so that was fine for me.

### One new thing I learned?
Hadn't used the python broadcasting in-line before, and also learned about the datetime format and timedeltas as dtypes.
