# **Homework 5**

## Contributions
I worked at separate times with Sarah, Masooma, and Shar on different portions of the assignment. I was mainly responsible for my work; we discussed solutions to issues we encountered together by comparing code and talking.

## Reflection

### What was the homework about?
This HW was about fitting models to data using different methods such as minimizing objective functions and using MCMC. 

### What was the hardest part of the HW?
Probably just solving issues related to "why is my MCMC not giving me values I like?!" which usually were simple solutions, but were hard to find out exactly where the issue was coming from in the depths of the code. 

### Easiest part of the HW?
Implementing the MCMC (and the other fits I guess) because we had a concrete example to pull from. Didn't mean it always worked first try with the results we wanted/expected (see above), but the MCMC was doing its thing with the info given. Just sometimes that info was wrong for what it should have been to give good results.

### One new thing I learned?
How to implement MCMC and what exactly it's doing (from log prior, posterior, proability).
