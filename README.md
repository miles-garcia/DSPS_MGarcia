- Why did you want to take the class?
- -> I think machine learning is really interesting and very quickly becoming super important for many fields (and certainly physics is one of them), so I think having some understanding of how it works will be very useful.

- What do you hope to learn?
- -> I want to learn about the "inner workings" of machine learning-- what it's useful for is one thing, and that's obviously important, but I think it would be interesting to get a better understanding of what the code actually does, and how that brings about the results we use ML for.

- Strengths that will help you in the class?
  -> I think I've always been pretty comfortable with coding in general, and I've always found machine learning related topics interesting, so I think that I will be motivated to learn about these topics.
